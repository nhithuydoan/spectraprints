"""This module contains functions for building 1-D boolean masks. These masks
may be built from human annotated text files, spindle state text files or
computationally computed using a local z-score threshold.

Functions:
    threshold:
        Returns a 1-D boolean by z-score thresholding produced values from
        a producer.
    artifact:
        Returns a 1-D boolean by reading human created annotations stored in
        a Pinnacle annotations file.
    state:
        Returns a 1-D boolean by reading Spindle detected sleep and wake states
        from a Spindle formatted file.
