            Path to an edf file.

            Directory location where preprocessed EDF will be saved to. The
            filename to save will be named epath.stem + '_preprocessed'. 
        channels:
            The channels to include in the processed producer.

            The sampling rate at which the data was collected.
        M:
            The downsample factor to reduce the number of samples produced by

            A sequence of expected lengths. The preprocessed data will be

            data is 66 hours long it will be trimmed to 48 hours.

            The number of processed samples along axis to yield from the 
            producer at a time. When called in a multiprocessing context this
            value should be set to the amount of samples any single process uses
            at one time.

            The axis of reading and production.

        None if not returning else returns preprocessed data array.
